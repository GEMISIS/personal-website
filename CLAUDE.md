# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a static personal website template designed for easy deployment to AWS S3, GitHub Pages, or similar hosting services. The site is configuration-driven, using JSON files to populate content across multiple pages (Home, Projects, Experience, Contact).

## Architecture

### Configuration-Driven Design

All content is controlled through JSON configuration files in the `configs/` directory:

- **config.json**: Main configuration including user profile, social media links, site keys (Google reCAPTCHA, Analytics), contact form settings (static/Formspree integration)
- **projects.json**: Project listings with metadata (name, description, language, media URLs, repo/download links). Can optionally specify `github_username` to auto-fetch GitHub repos via API
- **experience.json**: Timeline items (education, career, achievements) with dates, titles, subtitles, types, and custom icons. Can be displayed chronologically or reverse-chronologically
- **resumes.json**: Resume file links and titles, with option to indicate if contact info is included

### Page Structure

Each HTML page follows the same structure:
1. **Header**: Fixed navigation bar generated by `generateNavBar()` in core.js
2. **Main content**: Page-specific content populated by corresponding JavaScript
3. **Footer**: Social media links generated by `setupSocialMediaLinks()` in core.js

### JavaScript Organization

- **core.js**: Shared utilities (navbar generation, metadata setup, social media links)
  - Uses vanilla `document.createElement()` instead of jQuery for better performance
  - `setupPage(activePage)` initializes navbar and config for each page

- **home.js**: Home page functionality
  - Populates user profile image and bio from config
  - Displays resume download options
  - Fetches and displays RSS feed cards from Medium/Blogger/WordPress via rss2json.com API

- **projects.js**: Projects page functionality
  - Generates project cards from config and/or GitHub API
  - Language-based color coding (C#, Unity, C++, Java, Python, etc.)
  - Modal system for displaying media (YouTube, Vimeo, native video, images)
  - Caches GitHub data in localStorage to handle API rate limits

- **experience.js**: Experience timeline page
  - Timeline visualization with alternating left/right layout
  - Color-coded by event type (start=blue, end=purple)
  - Default icons or custom images for each timeline item

- **contact.js**: Contact form functionality
  - Supports static mode with Formspree integration (standard or Gold)
  - Google reCAPTCHA integration for spam protection
  - Dynamic mode mentioned but not implemented

### Styling

- Bootstrap 4 for responsive layout
- Font Awesome for icons
- Custom CSS in `css/` directory:
  - `theme.css`: Main theme styles
  - `social.css`: Social media link styling

## Common Commands

This is a static site with no build process. To develop:

1. **Local development**: Open HTML files directly in browser or use a simple HTTP server:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server 8000
   # or
   npx http-server
   ```

2. **Deploy to GitHub Pages**: Push to the repository and enable GitHub Pages in repository settings

3. **Deploy to AWS S3**: Upload all files to S3 bucket and configure for static website hosting

## Key Implementation Details

### Adding a New Page

1. Create HTML file following the structure of existing pages (index.html, projects.html, etc.)
2. Add the page link to the `links` array in `generateNavBar()` in core.js
3. Call `setupPage("Page Name")` in a script tag at the bottom of the new HTML file

### Modifying Configuration

- **User profile**: Edit `configs/config.json` - update user, user_picture, user_bio, user_bio_brief, description, keywords
- **Social media**: Edit `social_medias` array in config.json with id, name, color, icon (Font Awesome class), and link
- **Projects**: Edit `configs/projects.json` - add/remove projects with name, description, language, media_urls, repo_url, download_url, demo_url
- **Experience**: Edit `configs/experience.json` - add timeline items with date, time (start/end/mid), title, subtitle, type, image, description
- **Resumes**: Edit `configs/resumes.json` - add resume files with file path and title

### Contact Form Setup

The contact form has two modes controlled by `static` flag in config.json:

1. **Static mode (true)**: Uses Formspree
   - Standard: Form submits directly to `formspree_link`, user sees Formspree receipt page
   - Gold (`formspree_gold: true`): AJAX submission via jQuery, shows toast notification, no page redirect

2. **Dynamic mode (false)**: Requires AWS Lambda setup (not currently implemented)

### Media Display System

Projects and demos support multiple media types:
- YouTube videos (auto-detected via regex)
- Vimeo videos (auto-detected via regex)
- Native video files (.mp4, .ogg, .webm)
- Images (.png, .jpg, .jpeg, .gif, .bmp, .svg)
- Demo iframes (for live demos)

Media is displayed in a Bootstrap modal with tabs for multiple media items per project.

### GitHub Integration

If `github_username` is set in projects.json, the site will fetch public repositories from GitHub API and merge them with manually-defined projects. The site caches GitHub data in localStorage to avoid rate limit issues when the API returns an error.

## Important Notes

- The email in the config.json is intentionally an anti-spam placeholder
- All external links open in new tabs (`target="_blank"`)
- Dates in experience.json use UTC to prevent timezone-related display issues
- Project cards are sorted by `updated_at` date (most recent first)
- Navigation uses Bootstrap's responsive collapse for mobile devices
